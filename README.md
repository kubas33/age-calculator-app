  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)

### What I learned

I learned a lot about javascript. 
It took me a while trying to make calculation script. At first tried to calculate differece in dates in miliseconds ant then converting this do years, months, and days but it didnt work properly.

I also used SASS for the first time.
